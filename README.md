This is a Pytorch recreation of a paper for a class

## Hyperparameter Tuning
For the most part, I closely follow the recipe given in the original paper.  Obviously, use of a different optimizer, learning rate, learning rate scheduler, number of epochs, etc. could improve performance.  However, I did not want this to turn into a time-intensive hyper-parameter tuning project, so I followed as much as I could from the paper.  If you would like to fork my code and get better performance using new hyper-parameters, feel free to do so.
